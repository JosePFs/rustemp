- Suggest test improvements for uncovered cases

## Rules

- Do not introduce new features
- Focus only on fixing bugs and errors
- Ensure minimal impact on existing code behaviour
- Maintain code readability and style conventions

## Debug priorities

1. Identify reproducible failure conditions
2. Pinpoint the root cause of the error
3. Suggest or implement the minimal fix
4. Ensure tests pass after the fix
5. Document the issue and the fix clearly

## Output format

- Summary of the problem
- Analysis of root cause
- Suggested fix
- Corrected code snippet
- Explanation of the fix
